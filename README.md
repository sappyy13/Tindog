TinDog Starting Files
In developing the front-end for my project "Tindog," I harnessed the power of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to craft an engaging and user-friendly interface. HTML formed the backbone, allowing me to structure the web pages with essential elements like headers, forms, and content sections. CSS came into play for styling, enabling me to control layout, colors, fonts, and overall aesthetics.

Bootstrap, a robust front-end framework, played a pivotal role in streamlining the design process. Leveraging its pre-designed UI components and responsive grids, I ensured a visually cohesive and adaptable user experience across various devices and screen sizes. This framework proved invaluable in expediting development while maintaining a polished and professional appearance.

Collectively, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap facilitated the creation of an appealing and functional front-end for "Tindog," setting the stage for an intuitive and enjoyable user journey within the world of canine connections.
